# Cryptocurrencies

In this module, data has been preprocessed and made to fit an unsupervised learning model where null values were dropped, columns were 
transformed, and dataframes were created all in order to make the data work within the model. Predictions were made and shown in the 
array and the scatter plots.

The final product is a representation of what the data should be, shown through a 3D plot as well as a scatter plot of Total Coins Mined 
compared to the Total Coin Supply.
